# flockture

There is a piece of genetic analysis software called 
[_flock_](http://www.bio.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/documents/Photos_professeurs/Julie_turgeon/Publications_PDF/DuchesneTurgeon_JoH_FlockKproblem.pdf) that claims
to be quite novel in its approach to clustering individuals on the basis
of their genotypes.  In a manuscript, we have shown with a simple mathematical
analysis that the underlying model
used in the FLOCK approach is one of the models implemented in the program
[_structure_](http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html).

Another way of demonstrating the similarity between the programs is to
modify the source code of _structure_ so that it works like _flock_.
That is what we have done here.


We have started with the _structure_ distribution as the very first commit.
We also have a branch called _structure_ that points to that first commit.

In the master branch we are making changes to convert structure to flock, i.e.,
flockture.

Note, don't get the _structure_ source from here.  It was written by Jonathan Pritchard
and his collaborators and is available here:

http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html

It is posted here with permission.  

We repeat, don't use this as a source for structure's code.

We also don't recommend using this code to emulate the behavior of flock.  Better to just use
structure.  However, flockture runs much faster than flock itself and can return more information 
about intermediate calculations than flock does, so it might be useful for people  endeavoring
to understand how the flock algorithm behaves.


## Running stuff

Here is a little primer on how to run it and get some results
from it.

1.  First make flockture
```sh
# from within src in the shell
make
```

```r
# then open RStudio and do this:
source("R/flockture.R")  # source some functions
```
Then execute the R commands in the file `fun_devel_stuff.R` to get a 
picture of how to use the package and run flockture.
